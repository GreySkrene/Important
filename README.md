# Important
I have three years of code I uploaded to Github, but I made most of that code for various classes in college. I am in the process of figuring out what I can share
to improve my portfolio and what I cannot. The code currently available is code I literally wrote over a weekend (the 'apps' that I made), So it is in no way 
representative of what I can do with Java, C++, and Python.
